   "Description": "Goldstone is not a gemstone but rather it is a type of glass made with copper.  The most common form of goldstone gives the illusion of being reddish brown although in fact that color comes from the copper crystals and the glass itself is colorless.\nThe manufacturing process for goldstone was discovered in the 17th century in Venice by the Italian Miotti family.  They were granted an exclusive licence of manufacture by the Doge. Persistent folklore attributes the discovery and secret of goldstone to an unnamed Italian monastic order, giving rise to the alternate name \"monk's gold\" or \"monk stone\". Another name \"stellaria\" is baes on the starry internal reflections.\nNo matter what it's called, it is a beautiful!\n\n\nThis set includes gorgeous silver bracelet stamped .925 and measures 8\" (total length including clasp) and matching sterling pendant.

   "Description": "Up for auction is this yardman 20\"cut push mower in USED CONDITION. \nI used it for couple of years occasionally. This year I tried but it was hard to start. I need to do it about 20-30 times to make it work. I believe something simple should be done to fix it. But I don?t know how and it?s too big to take it to the shop. So I decided to sell it.\nThis is pick up only in Dallas, Texas 75244\nPlease, don?t hesitate to ask questions. I?m not ?technical? person and not familiar with its features. But I?ll do my best to find out the answers. \nTHANK YOU FOR VISITING MY AUCTION & HAPPY BIDDING!!!",
